title: Winch
order: 6

The winch actuated the remover, allowing a single remover to act for multiple printers. The winch uses vectran connected to  custom 3d printed barrel to pull the remover. We choose a NEMA23 motor to give us enough torque to not lift the remover as well as pull up the magnetized  print bed.
