3D printing still requires a human to unload the part and restart the print, tasks that could be automated. By automating these tasks, you can run prints overnight without human supervision. Looking at the market, all the current solutions are too expensive and hard to scale up.

We set out to design a system that can cater multiple printers and be as cheap as possible. In the end we designed a system that costs around $250 that currently services 4 printers. With few modifications to the frame, the frame can be extended vertically to house more printers for relatively little costs.
