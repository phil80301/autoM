This design utilizes only 2 servos coupled together with 2 differentials to both enclose and flex the bed. The spur gears were laser-cut from Delrin and the miter gears were printed in PLA. The part that encloses on the bed have tetrahedral shaped funnels that increase the margin of error. Below is a diagram showing how the gear create the movement.
