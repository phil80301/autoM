## Design Considerations
The frame is the backbone of the mechanical stricture and had to house the entire project. One important design constraint is that the printers must be cantilevered in order to allow for the remover to pass through within the structure. This led to our 8020 frame design with wooden cantilevered shelfs. Our print remover slides along the interna 8020 beam by means of a winch at the top of the structure. This means that the design can be expanded taller to fit more printers without much trouble.
